### About

*[Catan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catan)*, also known as *The Settlers of Catan* is a game of monopoly on the weirdly hexagonal island of Catan. Players compete for resources, building settlements and infrastructure while racing to reach 10 victory points.

This project is an adaptation of the basic 4-player setup. Online functionality has been implemented with Firebase.
